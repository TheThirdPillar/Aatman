## Introduction

To understand Identity, you need to understand the **SkillsChain Network** and **Shield**. **Identity** is the second piece of the technology offering from people at Third Pillar Foundation. It is the root application on the SkillsChain Network, that allows user to manage their meta (profile, education, work) and skill identities and other documents, encrypted and stored on the network (local, with the service provider, and IPFS). 

Features include :

    * [] Request signature/attestation from other users/communities for one document or a set of document, Records.
    * [] Manage Signature Requests - Sign/Attest/Decline/Reject
    * [] Request Access to verified Documents and Records from other users.
    * [] Manage Access Requests - Accept/Decline/Sent/Revoke/Cancel
    * [] A passbook for SkillTokens - Balance/Transactions
